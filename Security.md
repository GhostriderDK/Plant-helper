## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover any security vulnerabilities or issues in our code, please let us know immediately. We take security seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

To report a security issue, please follow these steps:

1. Email us at security@example.com with subject [Vulnerability] and a detailed description of the vulnerability or issue.
2. Include any relevant information, such as steps to reproduce the issue or code snippets.
3. Allow us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and address the issue before disclosing it to others.

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly request that you refrain from publicly disclosing any security vulnerabilities or issues until we have had a chance to address them. This allows us to protect our users and provide appropriate fixes or mitigations.

## Bug Bounty Program

We currently do not have a bug bounty program in place. However, we greatly appreciate your help in identifying and reporting security issues to us.

## Security Best Practices

While working with our code, we recommend following these security best practices:

- Keep your development environment and dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.
- Use strong and unique passwords for all accounts associated with the code.
- Regularly backup your code and data to prevent loss in case of security incidents.
- Be cautious when integrating third-party libraries or plugins.
- Implement secure coding practices and validate user input to prevent common vulnerabilities.

## Disclaimer

Please note that while we strive to provide secure code, no system is completely immune to security vulnerabilities. By using our code, you acknowledge and accept the inherent risks involved.
